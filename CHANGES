This is a list of changes made to Ved since the initial posting in April/99 of
version 3.0. Minor changes in docs, etc. do not trigger a revision update.

April 24, 1999

	Changed my email/www addresses to the uniserve domain.

May 3, 1999
	
	Made comments about makedepend in README

May 5, 1999 (Version 3.0.1)

	Fixed bug which moved block markers which were in the
	edit line after insert/delete in same line.
	
	version number is printed with -? info
	

May 7, 1999 (Version  3.0.2)
	
	Added block-wrap function.
	
	Cursor movement in menus now does wrap-around from top to bottom.
	
	Clicking on the scrollbar now moves to the relative line, not the
	relative position.
	
	Added option to enable/disable scroll indicators. See docs for
	the rc option scroll_indicator.

	Cleaned up the docs a bit by printing the rcfile option lines
	in a larger font.

	A minor bug in ncurses has been worked around. See comments in
	scroll_ind.c for details.
	
	Thomas E. Dickey tested the code out on solaris, and wrote the fallback.c
	functions. In doing this he needed to outcomment the mouse and resize
	code. This as been added to the main source code. If NCURSES_VERSION is
	not defined, we don't include any of that code. This should mean that
	you can compile Ved with old curses. Please let me know of success!
	I am not prepared to support Ved on anything other than Ncurses/Linux
	at this point, so you are on your own. No changes are being made to 
	documentation to reflect non-ncurses installations.
	
	If your libs are missing asprintf() or strsep() they are included in
	fallback.c. You need to set a define in the Makefile for this to work.
	
	Fixed over/underflow error in word move routines when at start/end of
	buffer.
		
September 18, 1999 (Version  3.0.3)

	Fixed one-off error in delete line. It was deleting the first character
	of the next line.

March 17, 2000
	Fixed one-off error in buffer-info. It was reporting that the cursor
	was on line #1 when at the end of file.
	
April 2, 2000 (Version 3.0.4)

	After upgrading to Linux Mandrake 7.0 I started to get some funny errors.
	Seems that strdup() in the library supplied with this distro doesn't like
	being passed a NULL ptr. I've gone over the code in a number of places
	and done explicit checks for the passing of NULL to strcpy(). Also,
	made a change to translate_delim_string() so that an empty string
	is returned to the caller as NULL ptr.
	
	make proto stopped working. For some unknown reason I have to add
	the -E option with the arg /lib/cpp. Funny, since this is the default.
	Discussions with T.E. Dickey indicate that the current rpm is 4.6.
	A version 4.6a is avaliable on his site with works properly.
	
	The clean up code after a buffer deletion and the buffer init code
	has been fortified. Was causing occasional seg errors due to my
	carelessness.

November 4, 2000

	Fixed annoying bug which created filenames starting with a NULL if
	the backup directory had not be set. This entailed a minor change
	to the tilde expansion routine so that it returns the original
	arg instead of a NULL if the arg's first character was a '\0'.
	
October 2, 2002

	Fixed one off error in macro_add_learned(). I was copying one too many
	characters from the scratch buffer into the macro buffer which caused
	extra characters in subsequent macro definitions.

May 1, 2004

Fixed one-off problem in dialog.c which caused barfing on certain
sizes of terminals.

Seems that the correct includes are time.h (not sys/time.h) and errno.h.
